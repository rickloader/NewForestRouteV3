4SUB 4121. 4SUB series 4121 - 4130 The modern all steel Class 405 BR EMU's in BR/SR dark malachite green livery with Lion on a Wheel logo. Built in 1946/7. Doors have toplight vents above the window. 

This model has been completed with a great deal of help, advice and encouragement from Geoffrey Harrison, Roger Swaris and Rob Pope for providing me with photo's and details also for keeping me at it till it was finished.

*VERY IMPORTANT* Due to the unusual buffers and buffer arrangement, 4SUBS have a specific train assembly and are incompatible with all other coaching stock. 4SUB stock is completely interchangeable with all other 4SUB stock.

   When making consists follow this guideline: Front MTB - coach with buffer on front end, rubbing plate on rear end - coach with buffers on both ends - Rear MTB. MTB's can couple to non-4SUB stock using front coupling, but have bar couplings to connect to coach stock.

4SUB series 4121 - 4130 were built during 1946/7. They were a design with all steel side panels and roofs. The Motor brake thirds had been changed from compartments to semi-saloon ( A saloon with a partition in the centre) to accomodate more standing passengers. Doors had been given toplight windows with a sunken ventilator to provide more visability for standing passengers.  One of the trailer seconds had compartments throughout and the other was a semi-saloon with compartments at each end and a 4 bay saloon in the middle.

 There were a large amount of route ID numbers for the headcode indicator and obviously I cannot provide them all. The route numbers are in the file "RouteID.ace" and it would not be too difficult to change them with a graphics program like Paintshop Pro or similar.

This link can help in deciding which headcode to use: http://www.semg.org.uk/headcodes/eheadcodes.html

 I tested on MSTSBin 1.6 with all sound and display sliders at max on Dave Corfield's Dorset Coast, Making Tracks L&SE and EB's LBE routes. You may  have to reduced the sliders a notch or two on high polygon routes on older computers.
